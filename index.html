                    My name is Dagmawi Nebiat and I am a 20 year old student currently learning at
                    Adama Science and Technology University. I have progressed through the curriculum for three 
                    years and counting. I am working on my bachelors degree on Computer Science and Programming. 
                    In addition to this, I can also provide freelance services depending on the job.

                <p id="vision-para">
                    Many programmers have a common vision of being the best in their skills and prove that they have what it takes to 
                    achieve the best and "make the world a better place". Although it is quite similar in some aspects to what I am trying 
                    to achieve, it is not quite the same. My vision is to have a good knowledge base in each aspects of the profession 
                    that interests and as a by-product give back to the community as beneficial as possible. Some may cheer, some may ridicule 
                    but that will not halt me from reaching the next level whatever it is.

                    Passion

                <p id="passion-para">
                    Although programming is considered as passion for some, including me, it is not the only one. I also have a passion for
                    entertainment, art and music. They are intertwined with each other, even with programming. In my opinion it is best to include
                    other skills and hobbies and mixing it with one another. Here is an analogy to best describe my intention on this topic. "Better to be
                    like water rather than a rock. Even though a rock is strong with its conviction, it's not easily stirred towards new prospects. Unlike the former
                    , water is flexible and flows easily making it easy to take new stuff."  - General Iroh
